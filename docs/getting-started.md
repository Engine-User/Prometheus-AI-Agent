# Getting started

Five steps take you from nothing to a Prometheus that remembers you. Each step ends
with a check, so you know it worked before you move on. Everything runs on your
own machine.

## 1. Install

```bash
pip install prometheus
```

To read or change the code, clone it instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Engine-User/Prometheus-AI-Agent && cd Prometheus-AI-Agent
uv venv && uv pip install -e .
```

### Other ways to run it

In a checkout, `uv run prometheus …` needs no venv activation. Three ways to run it:

| Command | When |
|---|---|
| `uv run prometheus dashboard` | quick start, zero activation (recommended) |
| `source .venv/bin/activate` → `prometheus dashboard` | activate once, bare `prometheus` all session |
| `uv tool install .` → `prometheus dashboard` | install `prometheus` **globally**, forever |

**Check:** `prometheus connections` prints a list of integrations.

## 2. Add one key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `PROMETHEUS_PROVIDER=` and paste that provider's key. Anthropic is the default;
OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Kimi, GLM, OpenRouter, OpenCode Zen and
OpenCode Go work the same way. You can also paste a key in the dashboard
later. Either way the key stays in a `.env` on your machine and is never sent
to the browser.

Prometheus reads a model key from three places, and the first one that has it wins:
environment variables set before Prometheus starts, the `.env` in the folder you run
Prometheus from (or the nearest folder above it), and `~/.prometheus/.env`. A key you paste
in the dashboard goes to the folder's `.env` when there is one, and to
`~/.prometheus/.env` when there is not, so Prometheus finds it from any folder. When Prometheus
finds no key, the dashboard's "Set up Prometheus" page lists the paths it checked,
and `prometheus connections` prints the same list under "Model key". A git worktree
does not see the main checkout's `.env`: start Prometheus in the main checkout, or
copy the key's line into `~/.prometheus/.env`.

**Check:** run `prometheus` and say hi. It answers in the terminal.

## 3. Open the dashboard

```bash
prometheus dashboard          # → http://localhost:7777
```

`prometheus` and `prometheus dashboard` are two doors into the **same** Prometheus. The dashboard
is a small web server on your machine (`127.0.0.1`): the browser is the UI, and
the same process runs every turn. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and it starts your
Telegram bot too.

**Check:** send a message from the chat dock and watch the Overview diagram
light up as it flows through the harness.

## 4. Watch it remember

Say *"Remember that Alex prefers morning meetings."* Quit, and restart. Then
say *"Book a catch-up with Alex on Friday."*

**Check:** it books 9am, and **Memory ▸ Semantic** lists the fact. Your memory
is one file: `~/.prometheus/state.db`, the same from every folder. Set `PROMETHEUS_HOME`
to keep it somewhere else. If you ran Prometheus before v0.2, your memory is in the
`.prometheus/` folder you ran it from, and Prometheus keeps using it there until you copy
it: `mkdir -p ~/.prometheus && cp -R ./.prometheus/. ~/.prometheus/`.

## 5. Share memory with your other agents (optional)

[Prometheus Memory](https://www.waku.one) is a hosted memory that several agents
share, so a fact saved in Claude Code can be recalled here, and the other way
round.

```bash
pip install 'prometheus[mcp]'           # in a checkout: uv pip install -e '.[mcp]'
prometheus connect waku-memory                # or /connect waku-memory in the dashboard chat
prometheus skill export --to claude,codex     # optional: carry Prometheus's skills too
```

Your browser opens once to sign in. Restart Prometheus to load the `waku_memory_*`
tools.

**Check:** `prometheus mcp` names the account you signed in as, and
`prometheus connections` lists Prometheus Memory as connected.

To connect Claude Code, Codex, Hermes or Grok Bot to the same memory, see
[integrations](integrations.md#share-one-memory-with-your-other-agents-waku-memory).

Beside it, [treg](https://treg.to) gives Prometheus live data when it researches,
on your own treg account:

```bash
prometheus connect treg                       # or /connect treg in the dashboard chat
```

**Check:** `prometheus connections` lists treg as connected, and so does the
**Connections** page. More in
[integrations](integrations.md#live-data-for-research-treg).
